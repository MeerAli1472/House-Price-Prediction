In this project, we're working for a client who wants to create a model that can predict the price of apartments in the city of Buenos Aires â€” with a focus on apartments that cost less than $400,000 USD.
first we predict the price of house based on size,
second we predict price of house based on location,
third we predict price of house based on neighborhood,
last but not least we will predict the price of house based on everything
